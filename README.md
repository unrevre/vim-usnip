# Î¼Snip

Minimalistic snippet management for Vim.

## Installation

Check your favourite plugin manager or `:h pack-add` if you do not use any.

## Usage

This plugin uses `:h compl-function` to expand snippets. This also requires it
to attach to the `CompleteDone` autocommand, which has some changes to default
behaviour:

- Completions that contain `NUL` will have that character replaced by newline.
- At least one pair of delimiters (`{{++}}` by default) is required in any
  completion.

`<Tab>` in insert mode is remapped in a way that it will not work if a
delimiter pair exists elsewhere in the buffer. `i_CTRL-T` and `i_CTRL-D` may be
used instead.

Completions that modify existing text are handled properly, provided the cursor
is returned to the appropriate location.
